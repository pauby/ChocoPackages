# [webview2-runtime](https://chocolatey.org/packages/webview2-runtime)

The Microsoft Edge WebView2 control allows you to embed web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) in your native apps. The WebView2 control uses Microsoft Edge as the rendering engine to display the web content in native apps.

With WebView2, you can embed web code in different parts of your native app, or build all of the native app within a single WebView instance.
