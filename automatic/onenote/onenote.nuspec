<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->
<!-- Test your packages in a test environment: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment -->
<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces 
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements 
-->
<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->

### Ideas take shape in OneNote

## Create your way
Do you scribble great ideas on napkins and sticky notes? Is precise filing more your style? OneNote's got you covered whatever way you shape your thoughts. Type, write or draw with the free form feel of pen to paper. Search and clip from the web to picture ideas.

## Collaborate with anyone
Your team is conquering the idea of the century. Your family is planning the menu for a big reunion. Stay on the same page and in sync wherever you are.

## Think with ink
Ready. Set. Draw. A stylus or fingertip is the only tool you need. Take handwritten notes and convert them to typed text later. Highlight what's important and express ideas with colors or shapes.

## Access from anywhere
Take note. It's easy to pull up your content from anywhere, even if you're offline. Start on your laptop then update notes on your phone. OneNote works on any device or platform.
