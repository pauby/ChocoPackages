    <summary>Private Internet Access™
VPN Service encrypts your connection and provides you with an anonymous IP to protect your privacy.</summary>

## Why should I use PIA?

* Privacy Protection.
  We all need privacy, especially online. Your IP address and your browsing should be hidden from unnecessary surveillance. Rest assured that PIA’s virtual private network never keeps any usage logs — ever. * Unblock Censorship Filters
* Secure Data
  Keep your data encrypted for extra security. Don’t let anyone get their hands on unencrypted emails, pictures, banking details, or anything else best kept private.
* Complete Access
  Access all of your favorite content free from ISP throttling and annoying network restrictions. Enjoy unlimited bandwidth to stay connected to the world's best shows, apps, and games.

## Notes

* As of package version 290.3.7 (3.7 of PIA), only the 64-bit installer is available.
