VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

To verify the files using the project source:

1. Please go to the project source location (https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/posh-with) and download the source files;
2. Build the source to create the binary files to verify;
3. Use Get-FileHash -Path <FILE TO VERIFY> to get the file hash value from both the built file (from step 1 above) and the file from the package and compare them;

Alternatively you can download the module from the PowerShell Gallery ...

    Save-Module -Name posh-with -Path <PATH TO DOWNLOAD TO>

... and compare the files from the package against those in the installed module. Again use Get-FileHash -Path <FILE TO VERIFY> to retrieve those hash values.
