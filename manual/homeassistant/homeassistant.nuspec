<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->
<!-- Test your packages in a test environment: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment -->
<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->
<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

        <description>Open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first. Powered by a worldwide community of tinkerers and DIY enthusiasts. Perfect to run on a Raspberry Pi or a local server.

Check out [home-assistant.io](https://home-assistant.io/) for a [demo](https://demo.home-assistant.io/), [installation instructions](https://home-assistant.io/getting-started/), [tutorials](https://home-assistant.io/getting-started/automation/) and [documentation](https://home-assistant.io/docs/).

The system is built using a modular approach so support for other devices or actions can be implemented easily. See also the [section on architecture](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/architecture_index/) and the [section on creating your own components](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/creating_component_index/).

If you run into issues while using Home Assistant or during development of a component, check the [Home Assistant help section](https://home-assistant.io/help/) of our website for further help and information.
